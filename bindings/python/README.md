# genalyzer: Python Bindings

This package contains the python bindings for genalyzer, a library for computing data-converter performance metrics.

## Optional Features

To support pytest functionality, genalyzer includes pytest fixture to help manage plots and generate reports.

This is heavily based off [pytest-reporter-html1](https://github.com/christiansandberg/pytest-reporter-html1/tree/master). See [LICENSE](https://github.com/christiansandberg/pytest-reporter-html1/blob/master/LICENSE) for related licensing information. 

## Pytest Testing (of plugin)

Tests were heavily ported as well from [pytest-reporter-html1](https://github.com/christiansandberg/pytest-reporter-html1). File headers include attribution.
